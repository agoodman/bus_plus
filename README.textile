h1. Overview

Bus Plus is a standard for coordinating and streamlining communication between passengers and drivers, with the goal of minimizing user interaction.

h1. How It Works

Passengers make travel requests. "I am here. I want to go to the mall."

Requests are matched against available vehicles within reasonable range of serving the request.

Vehicles submit bids for the request (without driver interaction).

A vehicle bid is chosen (not necessarily lowest bidder).

Passenger and driver are notified of vehicle assignment.

When vehicle is about 5mins away, passenger receives a notification.
